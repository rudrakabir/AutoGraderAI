 Aditya Ubrani Let Locals Leads.pdf,Grading Complete,"Overall Score: 61/100

Strengths (according to Rubric):
*   **Understanding of Climate Crisis:** Demonstrates a good grasp of the complexities of climate change across different regions and contexts (sea level rise, drought, heatwaves) and avoids vague generalizations.
*   **Critical Thinking:** Applies critical thinking by questioning the effectiveness of top-down, one-size-fits-all solutions presented in the film and advocating for a different approach (LLA). Analyzes the reasoning behind the LLA approach.
*   **Original Vision & Audience Awareness:** Presents a clear, purposeful, and original vision for climate communication through the documentary idea, focusing on a narrative shift and considering the potential audience's perspective.
*   **Organization & Writing Quality:** The essay has a logical flow, staying focused on the central argument about locally led solutions and avoiding plot summary.

Areas for Improvement (according to Rubric):
*   **Engagement with the film:** While the essay critiques the film, it uses it primarily as a starting point for contrast rather than engaging deeply or critically with its broader content, arguments, or effectiveness beyond one scene.
*   **Evidence of growth/Personal growth:** The essay does not include references to initial thinking, free-writing, or reflections on shifts in understanding since the course began, making it impossible to assess growth.
*   **Use of critical thinking tools:** While critical thinking is applied, the essay does not explicitly mention or demonstrate the use of specific critical thinking tools or evaluative strategies as outlined in the rubric.
*   **Evidence & citation quality:** While evidence is used, citation quality is poor, with missing citation details for sources mentioned and no bibliography provided.
*   **Integration of Sources:** Sources are mentioned, but the integration could be deeper, weaving ideas more complexly from the film, reviews, and additional materials.

Detailed Comments:

*   **1. Understanding of Climate Crisis (11/20 pts):**
    *   *Grasp of key issues (7/8):* You effectively highlight the varied impacts of climate change globally and the need for context-specific solutions (""Climate change doesn't hit uniformly,"" ""different countries have different infrastructural, financial, and social landscapes""). You touch upon scientific (nature-based solutions), social (community empowerment), and political (power transfer, financing) dimensions, showing a solid understanding.
    *   *Engagement with the film (4/6):* You use the *Inconvenient Sequel* scene in India effectively to introduce your critique of global narratives. This shows you've gone beyond summary. However, the engagement is limited to this specific point; deeper analysis of other aspects of the film's content, arguments, or overall effectiveness is missing.
    *   *Evidence of growth (0/6):* This section requires you to show how your thinking has developed since the beginning of the course, perhaps referencing initial free-writing or early ideas. This element is not present in the essay.

*   **2. Critical Thinking & Use of Evidence (14/20 pts):**
    *   *Use of critical thinking tools (6/8):* You demonstrate critical thinking by questioning the assumptions behind global climate strategies and evaluating the effectiveness of different approaches (top-down vs. local). However, the rubric asks about applying specific tools or strategies (like the Baloney Detection Kit), and this explicit demonstration or reflection on the process is not evident.
    *   *Argument analysis (5/6):* You analyze the reasoning behind the ""one-size-fits-all"" critique and the principles of LLA, including potential risks (""authoritative power should be in the right hands""). Your analysis of the film's underlying argument is present but brief.
    *   *Evidence & citation (3/6):* You use examples (floating gardens, apps) and reference sources (Rahman et al., Nature Communications) to support your points about LLA and nature-based solutions. However, the points lost here are primarily due to citation issues (see section 7). Supporting points with *cited* evidence is crucial.

*   **3. Original Vision & Audience Awareness (13/15 pts):** Your proposed documentary vision is a clear, original, and purposeful message. It effectively articulates a shift in perspective (""turn the script around,"" ""What do we have to learn from them?""). By describing the content and tone, you implicitly consider an audience and tailor your communication strategy to evoke unity and respect rather than guilt. This section is a strong point.

*   **4. Integration of Sources & Personal Growth (10/20 pts):**
    *   *Integration of sources (6/8):* You weave together your critique of the film with ideas from academic sources (Rahman et al., Nature Communications) and examples of local practices. The sources are used to build your argument for LLA. Deeper integration might involve exploring potential tensions or connections between the film's approach and the LLA perspective more explicitly.
    *   *Personal growth (0/7):* Similar to ""Evidence of growth,"" this section requires reflection on how your understanding has shifted or insights gained *during the course*. This element is not present.
    *   *Personal connection (4/5):* Your vision for the documentary and the concluding thoughts clearly connect the material to your worldview regarding climate justice, unity, and respect. This feels authentic and meaningful.

*   **5. Organization & Writing Quality (8/10 pts):** The essay is well-organized with a clear introduction (critique of film setting up the problem), body paragraphs developing the LLA solution and its principles, and a concluding vision. It stays focused on the central idea. You successfully avoid summarizing the film's plot. Paragraph transitions are generally logical.

*   **6. Style, Grammar & Mechanics (3/5 pts):** The writing is generally readable, but there are some grammatical errors (""giving resources for driving,"" ""These aren't solutions aren't created"") and awkward phrasing (""The authoritative power should be in the right hands for optimal development of the locality""). Careful proofreading would catch these issues and improve fluency.

*   **7. Citations & Academic Integrity (2/10 pts):**
    *   *In-text citation quality (2/7):* You correctly identify the source (Rahman et al.) and year (2023) for one specific point, which is a good start. However, in-text citations for paraphrases or facts should include page or paragraph numbers. You also mention a ""Nature Communications Earth & Environment paper"" and ""reviews"" without providing any citation details (author, year, etc.), which means you haven't cited all sources used to support your points.
    *   *Bibliography formatting & completeness (0/3):* No bibliography is provided at the end of the essay listing all sources mentioned in the text.

To improve, focus on demonstrating growth since the start of the course, explicitly showing how you used critical thinking strategies, improving citation practices (in-text and bibliography), and engaging more deeply with the film's content beyond a single critique point."
A silent crisis film essay.docx,Grading Complete,"Overall Grade: 46/100

Strengths (according to Rubric):

*   **Engagement with the film (Rubric 1):** The essay effectively uses *An Inconvenient Sequel* as a starting point, identifying a perceived gap (the lack of focus on wildlife) and using this critique to launch its own argument.
*   **Original Vision (Rubric 3):** The essay presents a clear, purposeful message about the importance of recognizing the ""silent crisis"" facing wildlife due to climate change and its connection to human health. It avoids summarizing the film's plot.
*   **Use of Evidence (Rubric 2) & Integration of Sources (Rubric 4):** The essay supports its points with evidence from external sources (Greening, Wilson, Castonguay, Schmeller) and attempts to weave these ideas together with its critique of the film.
*   **Personal Growth & Connection (Rubric 4):** The essay reflects on the impression the film made and identifies an insight gained (""something important was missing""). It expresses personal feelings (""heartbreaking"") and connects the issue to a broader worldview regarding human dependence on other species' well-being.

Areas for Improvement (according to Rubric):

*   **Grasp of key issues (Rubric 1):** While the essay focuses well on the ecological/biological dimension (wildlife health), it does not demonstrate a broad grasp of the scientific, social, and political dimensions of the climate crisis as a whole, which the rubric requires.
*   **Evidence of growth (Rubric 1):** The essay does not reference initial thinking or free-writing to show development since the course began.
*   **Use of critical thinking tools (Rubric 2):** The essay does not explicitly apply principles like the Baloney Detection Kit or other evaluative strategies to analyze information or arguments.
*   **Argument analysis (Rubric 2):** The essay critiques the film's *focus* but does not analyze the *reasoning* within the film's arguments or the reasoning presented in the readings it cites.
*   **Audience Awareness (Rubric 3):** The essay does not identify a specific audience or tailor its tone, content, or strategies for a particular group.
*   **Integration of Sources (Rubric 4):** While external sources are used, the essay does not integrate ideas from reviews of the film, as specified in the rubric. The weaving of sources could also be smoother.
*   **Organization & Writing Quality (Rubric 5):** The essay's paragraph flow is sometimes choppy, and transitions are weak. While it has an introduction and conclusion and stays focused, the overall structure and flow impact readability.
*   **Style, Grammar & Mechanics (Rubric 6):** The essay contains numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, sentence fragments, and run-on sentences (""Animals not only suffer because of extinction but also experience stress, hunger, and disorientation. Research by Greening explains...""). This significantly impacts readability and suggests a lack of careful proofreading and editing.
*   **In-text citation quality (Rubric 7):** In-text citations are inconsistent in format (sometimes including page numbers, sometimes not) and completeness (e.g., the source for the ""3 billion animals"" statistic is unclear).
*   **Bibliography formatting & completeness (Rubric 7):** The bibliography formatting is incorrect and inconsistent, including URLs which are not standard for APA or MLA bibliography entries in this context. This indicates a lack of meticulous attention to detail.

Detailed Comments:

The essay presents a compelling core idea – that the impact of climate change on wildlife constitutes a ""silent crisis"" that deserves more attention, particularly given its links to human health. This idea is clearly articulated and serves as a good response to the film by highlighting a missing perspective. The use of external sources to support the points about species movement, ecosystem disruption, and zoonotic disease transmission is a strength, demonstrating an effort to go beyond personal opinion. The reflection on the personal impact of this realization and the connection to a broader worldview are also positive aspects.

However, the essay falls short in several key areas outlined by the rubric. The understanding of the climate crisis is primarily limited to the ecological dimension, neglecting the broader scientific, social, and political context mentioned in the film. There is no evidence of applying critical thinking tools or analyzing the arguments presented in the film or readings. The lack of audience awareness means the essay doesn't demonstrate consideration of how to best communicate this important message to a specific group.

Significant issues exist in the writing quality itself. The prevalence of grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures, and poor flow makes the essay difficult to read and follow in places. This impacts the clarity and persuasiveness of the argument.

Finally, the citation practices need substantial improvement. Both the in-text citations and the bibliography formatting are inconsistent and do not adhere to standard academic styles. This detracts from the academic integrity and presentation of the work.

To improve, the student should focus on demonstrating a broader understanding of the climate crisis, explicitly applying critical thinking strategies, identifying and writing for a specific audience, improving sentence-level clarity and grammar through careful editing, and mastering academic citation standards. Incorporating analysis of arguments from the film or readings, as well as integrating reviews, would also strengthen the essay according to the rubric."
FYS105_ASSIGNMENT_DHYANI_SHAH.pdf,Grading Complete,"Overall Grade: 90/100

Strengths (according to Rubric):

*   **Understanding of Climate Crisis (19/20):** The essay demonstrates a strong grasp of the climate crisis, moving beyond scientific facts to discuss crucial social and political dimensions like justice, finance, disinformation, and political action. It avoids vague generalizations. The engagement with *An Inconvenient Sequel* is highly critical and goes well beyond mere summary, analyzing the film's framing and omissions effectively. The essay explicitly references how reading the Eisenstadt et al. article altered perceptions and refined criticism, showing clear evidence of growth since the course began.
*   **Critical Thinking & Use of Evidence (20/20):** Excellent application of critical thinking tools is evident, particularly the explicit mention and application of the Baloney Detection Kit to analyze greenwashing claims. The essay provides a sophisticated analysis of the film's implicit arguments (e.g., focus on Gore, omission of justice) and the reasoning presented in the Eisenstadt et al. article regarding climate finance distribution. Key points are well-supported with cited evidence from the Eisenstadt et al. source, which is integrated effectively to bolster the critique of the film and the vision for an alternative.
*   **Original Vision & Audience Awareness (13/15):** The essay presents a clear, purposeful, and original vision for a climate documentary centered on justice, truth (anti-greenwashing), and grassroots empowerment. While not naming a specific demographic audience, the essay demonstrates strong audience awareness by considering the desired impact (empowerment vs. paralysis) and tailoring the proposed content, tone, and strategies (focus on vulnerable narratives, instruction on identifying greenwashing, highlighting agency) to achieve that purpose for viewers. It successfully avoids plot-pitching, focusing on the core ideas and themes.
*   **Integration of Sources & Personal Growth (19/20):** The essay effectively weaves together ideas from the film (as the subject of critique) and the Eisenstadt et al. article, using the latter to provide evidence and depth to the critique of the film's omissions regarding climate finance and justice. The reflection on how the Eisenstadt et al. article altered perceptions and refined criticism demonstrates clear personal growth. The essay also conveys a strong personal connection through its passionate articulation of a worldview centered on climate justice, truth, and empowerment, relating these values meaningfully to the material.
*   **Organization & Writing Quality (10/10):** The essay is exceptionally well-organized. It features a strong introduction that clearly sets up the critique and the alternative vision. Paragraphs flow logically, developing the arguments against the film's approach and detailing the elements of the proposed documentary. The conclusion provides a thoughtful summary and reinforces the core message. The essay stays focused on the key ideas of critiquing the film's blind spots and presenting a justice-centered, critical, and empowering alternative vision, successfully avoiding plot summary.
*   **Style, Grammar & Mechanics (5/5):** The writing is fluent, clear, and demonstrates careful attention to style and mechanics. Sentences are readable and varied. There are no significant grammatical errors or typos that impede understanding. The overall presentation reflects care in editing.

Areas for Improvement (according to Rubric):

*   **Original Vision & Audience Awareness (addressed in Strengths):** While strong in considering audience impact and tailoring content, explicitly naming a specific target audience demographic could potentially strengthen this point further, although the current approach is largely successful according to the rubric's criteria.
*   **Integration of Sources (addressed in Strengths):** The rubric mentions integrating ""film, reviews, and additional materials."" The essay effectively integrates the film and one additional source (Eisenstadt et al.) but does not incorporate reviews, which is a minor point but noted by the rubric.
*   **Citations & Academic Integrity (4/10):** This is the primary area for improvement.
    *   **In-text citation quality (4/7):** While citations are present for the Eisenstadt et al. source and used ethically to support claims, they consistently omit page or paragraph numbers. The rubric explicitly requires ""uses author, year, page/para numbers.""
    *   **Bibliography formatting & completeness (0/3):** The bibliography has significant issues. The entry for the cited Eisenstadt et al. article is incomplete and appears to include unrelated information (the title and abstract for a different article on fall prevention) before the link. An uncited source (World Bank CO2 emissions) is included. The formatting for the cited source is not fully consistent with standard academic styles (like APA or MLA) due to its incompleteness and the inclusion of extraneous text. This section requires meticulous attention to detail, which is lacking here.

Detailed Comments:

This essay is a sophisticated and compelling response to the assignment. The critical analysis of *An Inconvenient Sequel*'s limitations regarding climate justice and greenwashing is insightful and well-supported by the integration of the Eisenstadt et al. source. The vision for an alternative documentary is clear, original, and thoughtfully considers the impact on viewers, particularly in its focus on empowerment and critical literacy. The essay demonstrates a high level of critical thinking, strong writing quality, and clear personal investment in the topic, reflecting significant growth. The only major area needing attention is the citations section, specifically ensuring that in-text citations include page/paragraph numbers as required by the rubric and that the bibliography is complete, correctly formatted for all cited sources, and free of extraneous or uncited entries. Addressing the citation issues would bring this excellent essay closer to a perfect score."

Falak Shah_AU2440014_Be inconvenient your way (1).pdf,Grading Complete,"**Overall Grade:** 100/100

**Detailed Feedback:**

This essay demonstrates an exceptional understanding of the assignment's requirements and the course material, earning a perfect score according to the rubric. The writing is insightful, well-supported, and reflects significant critical engagement and personal growth.

**1. Understanding of Climate Crisis (20/20 pts)**
*   **Grasp of key issues (8/8 pts):** Excellent. The essay clearly articulates the scientific (biochar, algae, indoor air pollution), social (focus on vulnerable populations, environmental justice, unequal impact), and political dimensions (Paris Agreement, specific government programs like Ujjwala Yojana, Climate Change Trust Fund, Electrify Africa Act). It avoids vague generalizations by providing specific examples and statistics (e.g., Bangladesh emissions vs. threat, EPA data on US neighborhoods, FAO data on indoor air pollution).
*   **Engagement with the film (6/6 pts):** Outstanding. The essay goes far beyond summary, using *An Inconvenient Sequel* as a critical starting point. It directly engages with the film's content by critiquing its focus on politicians/CEOs and its lack of attention to vulnerable communities and grassroots efforts, which directly inspires the student's own vision.
*   **Evidence of growth (6/6 pts):** Clearly demonstrated. The essay explicitly references initial thinking (""When I first watched An Inconvenient Sequel..."") and shows development (""Reflecting on these ideas over the past week, I realise how much my understanding of climate change has deepened. Initially, I viewed climate action through the lens of technical fixes... But now I see it as a complex social issue...""). This articulation of a shift in perspective is strong evidence of growth.

**2. Critical Thinking & Use of Evidence (20/20 pts)**
*   **Use of critical thinking tools (8/8 pts):** Exemplary. The essay explicitly states the application of Carl Sagan's Baloney Detection Kit (""Using Carl Sagan’s Baloney Detection Kit (1995, ch. 2), I critically evaluated... compared multiple sources, asked who benefits... identified what was missing""). This is a direct and effective application of course concepts.
*   **Argument analysis (6/6 pts):** Strong. The essay analyzes the reasoning behind the film's narrative choices (focus on top-down solutions) and specific government policies (e.g., Ujjwala Yojana excluding biochar, Electrify Africa Act prioritizing large farms), contrasting them with the realities and needs of grassroots innovators. This goes beyond simple agreement/disagreement.
*   **Evidence & citation (6/6 pts):** Excellent. Key points are consistently supported with evidence from a variety of cited sources (World Bank, EPA, FAO, UNEP, government reports, etc.). The evidence is integrated effectively to build the argument for the importance of grassroots solutions and the justice dimension of climate change.

**3. Original Vision & Audience Awareness (15/15 pts)**
*   The essay presents a clear and purposeful message for the proposed film, ""We the Future,"" centered on climate change as a justice issue and highlighting grassroots innovation. It effectively avoids plot-pitching, focusing instead on the core ideas and themes. A specific audience (young people in urban/suburban areas) is identified, and the essay thoughtfully explains how the content (stories of young inventors) and message are tailored to connect with and motivate this audience.

**4. Integration of Sources & Personal Growth (20/20 pts)**
*   **Integration of sources (8/8 pts):** Highly effective. The essay seamlessly weaves together ideas from the film (as a point of critique and departure), a review (Aronoff), and numerous additional sources (data from World Bank, EPA, FAO; research on biochar, algae, microgrids; policy details from government/USAID reports) to support its central argument and vision.
*   **Personal growth (7/7 pts):** Clearly articulated and central to the essay's narrative arc. The reflection on shifting from a focus on technical fixes to recognizing climate change as a complex social justice issue is well-explained and impactful.
*   **Personal connection (5/5 pts):** Meaningful. While not a personal anecdote, the connection is made through the student's evolving worldview and the inspiration drawn from the material to create a specific vision for climate communication (""This gap in representation inspired me to imagine a different kind of movie...""). This creative response demonstrates a deep personal engagement with the topic.

**5. Organization & Writing Quality (10/10 pts)**
*   The essay is well-organized with a clear introduction that sets up the critique and the vision. Paragraphs follow a logical flow, moving from critiquing the film to presenting the alternative vision, providing detailed examples, discussing policy implications, reflecting on growth, and addressing the audience. The essay stays focused on its core ideas (climate as a justice issue, grassroots solutions) and successfully avoids summarizing the plot of *An Inconvenient Sequel*. The conclusion provides a strong summary and final thought.

**6. Style, Grammar & Mechanics (4.5/5 pts)**
*   The writing is generally fluent, sentences are readable, and the overall presentation reflects care. There is a minor grammar error (""its a justice problem"" should be ""it's a justice problem""), but this is a very small issue in an otherwise polished piece. Proofreading is generally strong.

**7. Citations & Academic Integrity (10/10 pts)**
*   **In-text citation quality (7/7 pts):** Excellent. Facts, paraphrases, and specific details are consistently cited using author, year, and page/paragraph numbers where applicable. The integration of citations is ethical and supports the claims effectively.
*   **Bibliography formatting & completeness (3/3 pts):** Complete and consistently formatted. All in-text sources are listed, and the format appears consistent (following an APA-like style). Attention to detail is evident.

Overall, this is an outstanding essay that fully meets and exceeds the expectations of the rubric. It demonstrates sophisticated critical thinking, a deep understanding of the subject matter, and a thoughtful, well-supported original vision."
A silent crisis film essay(1).docx,Grading Complete,"Overall Grade: 45/100

This essay presents an interesting core idea regarding the overlooked impact of climate change on wildlife and its connection to human health. It uses external sources to support this point and engages with the film by noting a significant omission. However, the essay struggles with several key requirements of the rubric, particularly in demonstrating critical thinking tools, evidence of personal growth since the course began, audience awareness, writing quality, and proper citation formatting.

Detailed Feedback According to Rubric:

**1. Understanding of Climate Crisis (Estimated: 10/20)**
*   **Grasp of key issues (8 pts):** The essay demonstrates a grasp of the scientific and social dimensions related to the impact on wildlife and the link to zoonotic diseases. It uses specific examples (Australian wildfires, range shifts, disease transmission) supported by sources, avoiding vague generalizations within this specific focus. However, it doesn't engage with the broader scientific, social, *and political* dimensions of the climate crisis as a whole, focusing narrowly on one aspect. (Score: 6/8)
*   **Engagement with the film (6 pts):** The essay effectively uses the film as a starting point by identifying a perceived gap (""something important was missing: the wildlife""). This goes beyond summary and offers a critical perspective on the film's content and focus. (Score: 4/6)
*   **Evidence of growth (6 pts):** The essay mentions the film inspired the idea but does not reference initial thinking, free-writing, or show development in understanding *since the course began*. This criterion appears unmet. (Score: 0/6)

**2. Critical Thinking & Use of Evidence (Estimated: 8/20)**
*   **Use of critical thinking tools (8 pts):** The essay does not explicitly mention or demonstrate the application of specific critical thinking tools like the Baloney Detection Kit or other evaluative strategies taught in the course. (Score: 0/8)
*   **Argument analysis (6 pts):** The essay analyzes the film's *omission* of wildlife impact as a weakness in its argument. It also presents and analyzes the reasoning from the provided sources regarding the links between climate change, wildlife behavior, and disease transmission. (Score: 4/6)
*   **Evidence & citation (6 pts):** The essay supports its key points about wildlife impacts and health risks with evidence from the provided sources (Greening, Wilson, Castonguay, Schmeller). The integration is functional but often presents a statement followed by a citation rather than weaving the evidence more smoothly into the argument. (Score: 4/6)

**3. Original Vision & Audience Awareness (Estimated: 8/15)**
*   The essay communicates a clear, purposeful message: the impact of climate change on wildlife is a neglected ""silent crisis"" with serious implications for human health. This idea is central and consistently articulated. (Score: 8/10 for clear message)
*   However, the essay does not identify a specific audience or consider how the tone, content, or strategies might be tailored to that audience. It reads as a general statement of the problem. (Score: 0/5 for audience awareness)
*   The essay successfully avoids plot-pitching and focuses on communicating its core idea.

**4. Integration of Sources & Personal Growth (Estimated: 9/20)**
*   **Integration of sources (8 pts):** The essay integrates ideas from the film (as a point of critique/inspiration) and several additional sources to build its argument about the ""silent crisis."" However, it does not integrate ideas from ""reviews"" as mentioned in the prompt/rubric. The integration style is somewhat basic. (Score: 4/8)
*   **Personal growth (7 pts):** The essay notes that the film left a ""strong impression"" and inspired the idea, and mentions finding the quiet nature of the crisis ""heartbreaking."" This indicates a personal insight gained, but it does not reflect on shifts in understanding or insights gained specifically *since the course began*. (Score: 3/7)
*   **Personal connection (5 pts):** The essay hints at a personal connection through phrases like ""What I found heartbreaking"" and ""Such an alarming situation compels us,"" relating the material to a worldview that values wildlife and human health. However, it does not delve into personal experience or connect the material to the student's life in a deeper, more meaningful way. (Score: 2/5)

**5. Organization & Writing Quality (Estimated: 5/10)**
*   The essay has a recognizable introduction that sets up the topic. The paragraph flow attempts to move logically from the film critique to the wildlife impact, evidence, and health links. However, transitions are often abrupt, and some paragraphs feel like lists of points. The conclusion is weak, primarily restating the problem. The essay stays focused on its key idea. (Score: 5/10)
*   The essay successfully avoids summarizing the film's plot.

**6. Style, Grammar & Mechanics (Estimated: 1/5)**
*   There are significant issues with grammar, sentence structure, and fluency throughout the essay. Examples include awkward phrasing (""sounds heard in forest,"" ""A bird flying everywhere and scared voices are heard,"" ""Real events have been proved,"" ""Immune system becomes weak because transmission between humans and animals""), run-on sentences or poorly constructed complex sentences (""Onset starts as environmental degradation which turns into a human health crisis thereby indicating how reliant our survival is on the well-being of other species""). These errors indicate a lack of careful proofreading and editing, significantly impacting readability. (Score: 1/5)

**7. Citations & Academic Integrity (Estimated: 4/10)**
*   **In-text citation quality (7 pts):** The essay includes in-text citations for information drawn from sources. It uses author and year, which is a good start. However, it only includes page/paragraph numbers for one citation (""Wilson et al., 2023, p. 6–7""), which is required by the rubric for paraphrases, facts, and allusions. The citation style is also inconsistent (sometimes author/year in parentheses, sometimes just author/year after the sentence). (Score: 3/7)
*   **Bibliography formatting & completeness (3 pts):** All sources cited in the text are listed in the bibliography. However, the formatting is inconsistent and does not adhere strictly to either APA or MLA style. There are inconsistencies in author name presentation, date placement, capitalization, and overall structure. This indicates a lack of meticulous attention to detail in formatting. (Score: 1/3)

**Overall Summary:**

The essay presents a relevant and interesting topic inspired by a critical observation of the film. It uses external sources to support its main points about wildlife impacts and health risks. However, it falls short on demonstrating several key skills expected at this level and outlined in the rubric, including explicit use of critical thinking tools, reflection on personal growth since the course began, audience awareness, and strong command of academic writing conventions (grammar, style, and citation formatting). Addressing these areas will be crucial for future assignments."
FYS 105 Essay 1 - being inconvenient my way.pdf,Grading Complete,"Overall Grade: 88/100

Detailed Feedback based on Rubric:

**1. Understanding of Climate Crisis (20 pts)**
*   **Score:** 18/20
*   **Strengths:** The essay demonstrates a strong grasp of the social and political dimensions of the climate crisis, particularly focusing on the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities and the political aspects of climate communication (e.g., critique of Gore's approach vs. focusing on local voices). It avoids vague generalizations by referencing specific locations and communities in Gujarat. The engagement with *An Inconvenient Sequel* goes beyond summary, offering a clear critique of its perceived limitations in representing diverse voices. The essay explicitly references a ""week of reflection, and learning"" and describes a ""paradigm shift"" in the student's thinking, showing development since the course began.
*   **Areas for Improvement:** While social and political dimensions are strong, the essay could perhaps integrate slightly more explicit discussion of the scientific underpinnings of the specific climate impacts mentioned (e.g., how climate change causes increased heatwaves, salinity intrusion, or affects biodiversity), though the focus is clearly on the human experience.

**2. Critical Thinking & Use of Evidence (20 pts)**
*   **Score:** 18/20
*   **Strengths:** The essay explicitly mentions applying a critical thinking tool by identifying and attempting to mitigate ""personal bias, a baloney."" It analyzes the reasoning and approach presented in the film (Gore's method) by contrasting it with the student's proposed alternative, demonstrating an assessment of communication strategies rather than just agreeing or disagreeing with the core message. Key points are supported with cited evidence from various sources (e.g., Bisht on heatwaves, Roy on coastal impacts, Kaur on mangrove projects, Kukreti on Prosopis juliflora, Jain et al. on eco-anxiety). The evidence is generally integrated effectively into the narrative of the proposed film.
*   **Areas for Improvement:** While bias is mentioned, a deeper application of other critical thinking principles (e.g., evaluating source credibility beyond just citing them, identifying potential logical fallacies in arguments encountered) could further strengthen this section.

**3. Original Vision & Audience Awareness (15 pts)**
*   **Score:** 14/15
*   **Strengths:** The essay presents a very clear and purposeful vision for climate communication: a film focusing on the lived experiences and resilience of marginalized communities in Gujarat. It clearly identifies specific audiences (youth, and importantly, the affected communities themselves) and details concrete strategies tailored to them (hand-held shots, local language, subtitles, visual imagery, social media campaigns, education). The focus is entirely on the *idea* and *purpose* of the film, successfully avoiding a scene-by-scene plot pitch.
*   **Areas for Improvement:** The audience is well-defined, but a slightly more detailed explanation of *why* these specific strategies (e.g., hand-held shots, local language) are particularly effective for the identified audiences would strengthen the argument for audience awareness.

**4. Integration of Sources & Personal Growth (20 pts)**
*   **Score:** 19/20
*   **Strengths:** The essay effectively weaves together ideas from *An Inconvenient Sequel* (as a point of contrast and critique), and numerous additional materials (academic articles, news reports, organizational websites) to build the case for its proposed vision and support specific examples. The reflection on personal growth is explicit and compelling, describing a shift from viewing the crisis as distant to a personal battle and highlighting growth in ""humility and empathy."" The personal connection to being from Ahmedabad and witnessing the impacts, while having a privileged background, is deeply meaningful and central to the essay's core argument.
*   **Areas for Improvement:** All required sources are integrated, but ensuring smoother transitions between external sources and the student's own ideas could occasionally enhance the flow.

**5. Organization & Writing Quality (10 pts)**
*   **Score:** 9/10
*   **Strengths:** The essay has a strong introduction that sets up the critique of the film and the student's personal stake. The body paragraphs follow a logical flow, moving from the general concept to specific examples and proposed techniques for the film. The essay stays focused on its central idea of highlighting marginalized voices through a specific communication strategy. It successfully avoids summarizing the plot of *An Inconvenient Sequel*. The conclusion thoughtfully wraps up the main points and reiterates the personal connection and growth.
*   **Areas for Improvement:** While generally logical, some paragraph transitions could be slightly smoother to enhance overall coherence.

**6. Style, Grammar & Mechanics (5 pts)**
*   **Score:** 4/5
*   **Strengths:** The writing is generally fluent and readable, with clear sentence structures for the most part. It reflects care in presenting ideas.
*   **Areas for Improvement:** There are occasional minor grammatical errors, awkward phrasing (""actively highlights... as he subtly questions""), or missing words that suggest the proofreading was not entirely meticulous. For example, ""despite being raised in a relatively fortunate household where needs and luxuries are catered to immediately. Keeping this personal bias, a baloney in mind, I chose..."" could be rephrased for better flow and grammatical correctness.

**7. Citations & Academic Integrity (10 pts)**
*   **Score:** 6/10
*   **Strengths:** The essay includes in-text citations for facts, paraphrased ideas, and allusions to specific content from sources. The format used (Author, Year) is generally consistent within the text. A bibliography is included.
*   **Areas for Improvement:** In-text citations sometimes lack page or paragraph numbers where applicable, reducing citation quality. The bibliography is missing at least one source cited in the text (Mathers-Jones & Todd). The formatting within the bibliography is inconsistent (e.g., capitalization of titles, spacing, indentation), indicating a lack of meticulous attention to detail required for full points in this section. This section needs significant attention for future assignments."

This essay demonstrates a strong understanding of the assignment requirements and the course material, presenting a thoughtful and well-supported vision for climate communication.

**Detailed Feedback According to Rubric:**

**1. Understanding of Climate Crisis – 20 pts**
*   **Grasp of key issues (8/8 pts):** Excellent grasp of the scientific (emissions, rising seas, biochar, algae, microgrids), social (environmental justice, poverty, race), and political dimensions (Paris Agreement, policy gaps, subsidies, trust funds). The essay effectively avoids vague generalizations by providing specific examples and data points (e.g., Bangladesh emissions, EPA data, biochar benefits).
*   **Engagement with the film (6/6 pts):** Goes well beyond summary. The essay uses *An Inconvenient Sequel* as a critical starting point, explicitly identifying its perceived shortcomings (focus on leaders/tech, lack of focus on vulnerable communities) as the inspiration for the proposed alternative film. This demonstrates critical engagement with the film's content and effectiveness.
*   **Evidence of growth (6/6 pts):** Clearly references initial thinking (""Initially, I viewed climate action through the lens of technical fixes"") and shows significant development since the course began by articulating a shift towards understanding climate change as a ""complex social issue that requires innovative solutions, fairness and empowerment.""

**2. Critical Thinking & Use of Evidence – 20 pts**
*   **Use of critical thinking tools (8/8 pts):** Explicitly mentions and applies Carl Sagan's Baloney Detection Kit principles by questioning the film's narrative, asking ""who benefits from its message,"" and identifying ""what was missing."" This demonstrates a direct application of course concepts.
*   **Argument analysis (6/6 pts):** Assesses the reasoning within the film (focusing on politicians/CEOs) and contrasts it with the reasoning for focusing on grassroots innovators. The essay doesn't just state disagreement but analyzes *why* the film's approach might be insufficient or misleading by highlighting alternative perspectives and evidence.
*   **Evidence & citation (6/6 pts):** Supports key points with a wide range of cited evidence, including data (World Bank, EPA, FAO), academic sources (Bilal et al.), reports (UNEP, Government documents, USAID/Borgen Project), and critical reviews (Aronoff). The evidence is well-integrated to support the critique of the film, the description of grassroots solutions, and the analysis of policy gaps.

**3. Original Vision & Audience Awareness – 15 pts**
*   **Original Vision (10/10 pts):** Presents a clear, original, and purposeful message centered on reframing climate communication to highlight climate justice, grassroots innovation, and the agency of marginalized communities. The vision for ""We the Future"" is distinct from the film critiqued and well-articulated through specific examples.
*   **Audience Awareness (5/5 pts):** Identifies a specific target audience (""young people in urban and suburban areas"") and thoughtfully considers how the film's content (stories of young inventors) and message (connecting viewers, encouraging policy support) would be tailored to resonate with this audience, addressing their potential feelings of being ""overwhelmed or disconnected.""

**4. Integration of Sources & Personal Growth – 20 pts**
*   **Integration of sources (8/8 pts):** Weaves together ideas from the film, the Aronoff review, and numerous additional sources (World Bank, EPA, Otto, FAO, Bilal et al., UNEP, government reports, etc.) seamlessly to build a cohesive argument and vision. The sources are used to provide context, critique, evidence for alternative solutions, and analysis of policy.
*   **Personal growth (7/7 pts):** Reflects meaningfully on a significant shift in understanding, moving from a focus on ""technical fixes"" to recognizing climate change as a ""complex social issue"" requiring ""fairness and empowerment."" This demonstrates deep engagement with the course material and critical thinking.
*   **Personal connection (5/5 pts):** While not detailing a specific personal anecdote, the essay connects the material to a shift in the student's ""worldview"" regarding climate action and justice. The passion for highlighting marginalized voices and demanding policy change feels personally resonant and fulfills the requirement for relating material to one's perspective.

**5. Organization & Writing Quality – 10 pts**
*   **Organization (10/10 pts):** Features a strong introduction that sets up the essay's purpose, logical paragraph flow moving from critique to vision to examples and policy analysis, and a thoughtful conclusion that summarizes the core message. The essay stays focused on its key ideas (critique of existing narrative, vision for justice-focused communication) and successfully avoids summarizing the film's plot.

**6. Style, Grammar & Mechanics – 5 pts**
*   **Quality (5/5 pts):** The writing is clear, fluent, and demonstrates careful proofreading. Sentence structure is varied and readable. Grammar and mechanics are consistently correct, reflecting care in editing and presentation.

**7. Citations & Academic Integrity – 7 pts**
*   **In-text citation quality (5/7 pts):** Cites paraphrases, facts, and allusions appropriately using the author-year format. However, there is a potential typo in the year for the Otto source (2025). While most citations follow the required format (Author, Year, page/para), the author name listed in the bibliography for the Government of India source (Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas) and the USAID source (The Borgen Project) does not match the author name used in the in-text citation (Government of India, USAID). Consistency between in-text and bibliography author names is crucial.
*   **Bibliography formatting & completeness (2/3 pts):** The bibliography lists all sources cited in the text (with the author name discrepancies noted above). The formatting (using Author, Year, Title, Source/URL) is mostly consistent with a standard citation style (like APA), but the author inconsistencies and the potential year typo for Otto indicate a lack of meticulous attention to detail required for full points.

**Summary:**

This is an outstanding essay that excels in critical thinking, engagement with sources, developing an original vision, and demonstrating personal growth. The writing is clear, well-organized, and polished. The only significant area for improvement lies in ensuring perfect consistency between in-text citations and the bibliography, specifically regarding author names and checking for potential typos in years. Addressing these minor citation issues would make this essay truly exceptional."

Detailed Comments:

**1. Understanding of Climate Crisis – 20/20 pts**
*   **Grasp of key issues (8/8 pts):** Excellent grasp demonstrated through the discussion of scientific aspects (biochar, algae, CO2 sequestration), social dimensions (focus on poor/marginalized communities, environmental justice, audience awareness), and political/economic factors (Paris Agreement, national emissions, policy design, subsidies, funding). The essay effectively avoids vague generalizations by providing specific examples like Bangladesh's emissions contribution, air quality issues in US neighborhoods, and detailed descriptions of grassroots innovations.
*   **Engagement with the film (6/6 pts):** The essay goes well beyond summary, using *An Inconvenient Sequel* as a critical starting point. It effectively engages with the film's content by identifying a significant gap in its representation (lack of focus on vulnerable populations and grassroots efforts) and critiquing its effectiveness in addressing the full scope of the crisis.
*   **Evidence of growth (6/6 pts):** The essay explicitly references initial thinking (""Initially, I viewed climate action through the lens of technical fixes..."") and clearly articulates the development of understanding since the course began, linking this growth to a broader perspective on climate change as a complex social issue requiring justice and empowerment.

**2. Critical Thinking & Use of Evidence – 20/20 pts**
*   **Use of critical thinking tools (8/8 pts):** The student explicitly mentions and applies Carl Sagan's Baloney Detection Kit, demonstrating critical evaluation strategies by comparing multiple sources, questioning who benefits from the film's message, and identifying what was missing from its narrative. This shows a direct application of course concepts.
*   **Argument analysis (6/6 pts):** The essay effectively analyzes the implicit arguments within the film (focus on top-down, technical solutions) and contrasts them with the reasoning behind policy decisions (e.g., subsidy programs, fund allocation) and the logic of grassroots innovations. It assesses the limitations and implications of these different approaches.
*   **Evidence & citation (6/6 pts):** Key points are consistently supported with evidence from a variety of sources, including academic reviews, government reports, international organizations, and specific studies. The evidence is well-integrated into the arguments about emissions, environmental justice, the feasibility and benefits of grassroots technologies, and the shortcomings of current policy frameworks.

**3. Original Vision & Audience Awareness – 15/15 pts**
*   The essay presents a clear and purposeful vision for a different climate movie, ""We the Future,"" centered on the crucial role of poor communities and the need for justice-oriented policy. It successfully identifies a specific target audience (young people in urban and suburban areas) and thoughtfully considers how the film's content (stories of young inventors) and tone would be tailored to connect with this audience and motivate specific actions beyond passive observation. The essay avoids describing a plot, focusing instead on the core ideas and framing of the proposed film.

**4. Integration of Sources & Personal Growth – 19/20 pts**
*   **Integration of sources (8/8 pts):** The essay skillfully weaves together ideas from the film (as a point of critique), the Aronoff review, and a rich array of additional materials (World Bank, EPA, FAO, UNEP, specific research, government reports). These sources are not just listed but are integrated to build the argument for the alternative vision and support claims about grassroots solutions and policy issues.
*   **Personal growth (7/7 pts):** The reflection on the shift in understanding from viewing climate action primarily through technical fixes to recognizing it as a complex social issue requiring fairness and empowerment is clearly articulated and demonstrates significant personal growth in perspective.
*   **Personal connection (4/5 pts):** While the essay doesn't include a specific personal anecdote, it effectively connects the material to the student's evolving worldview and intellectual understanding of the climate crisis as a justice issue. This reflection on a shift in perspective serves as a meaningful personal connection in the context of academic learning.

**5. Organization & Writing Quality – 10/10 pts**
*   The essay is well-organized with a strong introduction that sets up the critique and alternative vision. Paragraphs flow logically, moving from the critique of the existing film to the details of the proposed film's content, policy implications, personal reflection, and audience. The conclusion effectively summarizes the core message. The essay maintains a clear focus on the central idea of centering justice and grassroots innovation in climate communication and action, and it successfully avoids summarizing the plot of *An Inconvenient Sequel*.

**6. Style, Grammar & Mechanics – 4/5 pts**
*   The writing is generally fluent and readable, reflecting care in presentation. There are minor grammatical errors (""its a justice problem"" should be ""it's"", a missing comma/semicolon in ""more than admiration, they need support""), and the use of British spelling (""prioritise"") is inconsistent with the likely US context of the course. These are minor issues that could be caught with careful proofreading.

**7. Citations & Academic Integrity – 9/10 pts**
*   **In-text citation quality (7/7 pts):** In-text citations are consistently used to attribute facts, statistics, paraphrased ideas, and allusions. The format (Author, Year, and often page/paragraph number) is correctly applied and integrates ethically with the text.
*   **Bibliography formatting & completeness (2/3 pts):** The bibliography lists all sources cited in the text, demonstrating completeness. However, the formatting is simplified and not fully consistent with standard APA or MLA guidelines (e.g., missing publishers for books, incomplete details for journal articles). While consistent within its chosen simplified style, more meticulous attention to standard academic formatting would improve this section."
